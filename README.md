# HostelWorld Clone: TravelInn

> This is work done on the header section of a hostel listing page clone inspired by hostelworld.com.

This microservice was originally built to store data using a Docker image of Apache Cassandra. It was later refactored to store data using PostgreSQL. This repo contains the database files using Cassandra.
